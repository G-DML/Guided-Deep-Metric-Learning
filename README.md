# Guided-Deep-Metric-Learning

Implementation of our proposal for DML, called Guided Deep Metric Learning (G-DML), with some important datasets like: MNIST, Fashion MNIST, Cifar10.

It is necessary to use the PML repository by Musgrave: https://github.com/KevinMusgrave/pytorch-metric-learning#installation. For calculator of metrics, losses & reducers.
